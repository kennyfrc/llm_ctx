# Bug Debrief: Tree-Sitter Integration for JavaScript Language Pack

Context: Integrating tree-sitter JavaScript parser with the LLM_CTX language pack system

## 1. Problem & Initial Assumption

* **Problem**: The JavaScript language pack was not properly using the tree-sitter parser despite our intention to do so. Initial tests ran but were using a simple string scanner implementation instead of the more robust tree-sitter AST parser.

* **Initial Assumption**: We assumed that adding tree-sitter-javascript files to the project and updating the Makefile would be sufficient. We thought we only needed to link with the tree-sitter-javascript library (`.a` file) to get the parser working.

## 2. Discovery & Root Cause

* **Key Finding**: When examining the actual source code, we discovered that the implementation was not invoking any tree-sitter functions and was instead using a basic string scanning approach that looked for keywords like "function" and "class".

* **Deeper Investigation**: After adding proper tree-sitter integration, we encountered linker errors showing "Undefined symbols for architecture arm64" for all `ts_*` functions. This revealed that we were missing a crucial dependency.

* **Root Cause**: The tree-sitter JavaScript grammar (`libtree-sitter-javascript.a`) only contains the grammar definition but depends on the core tree-sitter runtime library (`libtree-sitter`) to provide the actual parsing engine. The build was missing this dependency.

## 3. The Fix

The solution involved several steps:

1. **Proper Tree-Sitter API Integration**:
   - Created a minimal `tree-sitter.h` header with necessary type definitions
   - Implemented proper AST traversal functions in `js_pack.c`
   - Added specific node type handling for function declarations, class declarations, and methods

2. **Correct Linking**:
   - Added explicit linking to both `libtree-sitter-javascript.a` (the grammar) AND `-ltree-sitter` (the runtime)
   - Updated Makefiles to include proper library paths: `-L/opt/homebrew/lib -ltree-sitter`
   - Added necessary include paths for tree-sitter headers

3. **Method Name Resolution**:
   - Enhanced the parser to correctly identify method names from the tree-sitter AST
   - Added special handling for constructors vs. regular methods
   - Improved property identification in class members

## 4. Mental Model Correction / Lesson Learned

* **Misunderstanding**: The core misunderstanding was about how tree-sitter's architecture works. We thought of tree-sitter as a single component rather than a two-part system with a runtime library and separate grammar definitions.

* **Corrected Understanding**: Tree-sitter has a layered architecture:
  - The core runtime library (`libtree-sitter`) provides the parsing engine with generic AST traversal functions
  - Language-specific grammar files (like `libtree-sitter-javascript.a`) define the syntax rules but depend on the core runtime
  - Both components must be properly integrated for parsing to work

* **Lessons for Future Integration**:
  1. When integrating parsing libraries, carefully analyze the dependency structure
  2. Use tools like `nm` or `ldd` to check what symbols a library provides vs. requires
  3. Test early with explicit function calls to verify integration
  4. Don't assume that string-based fallbacks are actually using the intended parser
  5. Method name resolution often requires additional tree traversal with tree-sitter ASTs

This experience reinforces the importance of verifying that we're actually using external libraries as intended, rather than just including them in the build but defaulting to simpler fallback mechanisms.
