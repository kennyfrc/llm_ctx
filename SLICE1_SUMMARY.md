# Slice 1: Basic Pack Discovery - Implementation Summary

This slice implements the first step of the dynamic language pack support specification - a basic pack discovery system that scans for available language packs and provides a command to list them.

## Implemented Features

1. **Pack Registry System**
   - Created a registry data structure to track available language packs
   - Implemented file system scanning for packs in the `packs/` directory
   - Added support for detecting parser.so files in language subdirectories

2. **Command-Line Interface**
   - Added a new `--list-packs` command-line option
   - Updated the help message to document the new feature
   - Implemented pack listing functionality when the option is used

3. **Testing & Verification**
   - Created a dedicated test case to verify pack discovery works correctly
   - Extended the Makefile to include the new code and test files
   - Ensured the test verifies the presence of the JavaScript pack

## Files Created/Modified

- **packs.h**: Defines the data structures and interface for pack discovery
- **packs.c**: Implements the pack discovery and listing functionality
- **main.c**: Modified to add the --list-packs command-line option
- **tests/test_packs.c**: Test case to verify the pack registry works
- **Makefile**: Updated to include the new source files and test target

## Testing Results

The implementation passes all tests and properly detects the JavaScript pack:

```
Testing pack registry functionality...
Test 1: Initialize pack registry... SUCCESS
Test 2: Check for JavaScript pack... PASS (JavaScript pack found)
Test 3: Print pack list
Available packs:
Available language packs:
  - javascript
SUCCESS
All tests completed.
```

The command-line option works as expected:

```
$ ./llm_ctx --list-packs
Available language packs:
  - javascript
```

## Next Steps

The next slice will build on this foundation to:
1. Define a consistent interface that all language packs must implement
2. Create a test language pack to verify the interface works
3. Extend the main program to dynamically load language packs
